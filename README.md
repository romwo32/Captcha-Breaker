# What are Captchas? 
A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is a human or a bot. It is commonly used on websites and online services to prevent automated programs (bots) from performing actions that could be harmful or undesirable, such as spamming, brute-force attacks, or data scraping.

CAPTCHAs typically present puzzles that are easy for humans to solve but difficult for machines. Some common types of CAPTCHAs include:

Image Recognition: Users are asked to select images that contain certain objects, such as traffic lights, bicycles, or animals.
Text Recognition: Users are shown distorted text or numbers and asked to type them into a box.
Audio CAPTCHA: A series of spoken letters or numbers that the user must enter.
ReCAPTCHA: A more advanced system, often used by Google, that not only tests human interaction but also helps improve machine learning by analyzing user behaviors.
CAPTCHAs help safeguard websites, prevent malicious actions, and protect online services from abuse by ensuring that only real humans can perform certain activities.

# Our Dataset

This repository contains a script designed to generate text-based CAPTCHAs with randomly assigned colors. The script allows for customization of font, spacing, and rotation parameters before generating each CAPTCHA. The dataset has been curated to exclude CAPTCHA instances that may be too difficult to recognize. For example, to avoid confusion between similarly-shaped characters (like the lowercase 'x' and uppercase 'X'), we have limited the available character set to "023456789ABCDEFHJKLMNPQRTUVWXYabdefghikmnqrty". Additionally, we introduce noise in the form of salt-and-pepper noise and varying line thicknesses and lengths to further challenge recognition.
